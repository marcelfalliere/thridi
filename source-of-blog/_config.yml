# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Thridi is the missing editor for Three.js and WebGL. It has code reload. It
  respects the standards. It aims at making life painless for three.js
  developers. It will have everything an IDE needs : code completion, inline
  errors, save, search. Still in the making, please subscribe to the newsletter
  at thridi.io to be kept up to date. It's moving fast, yo.
